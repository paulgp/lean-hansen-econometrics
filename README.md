# lean-hansen-econometrics

A gradual Lean formalization project for Bruce E. Hansen's *Econometrics*.

This repo is not meant to be a one-shot dump of isolated theorem files. The goal is to work through the book chapter by chapter, formalizing the core mathematical results, building reusable dependencies, and keeping a visible progress map.

## Scope

Primary source text:
- `HansenEconometrics.pdf` in the surrounding Hansen doodle project

Current emphasis:
- Chapter 2 (`Conditional Expectation and Projection`)
- Chapter 3 (`The Algebra of Least Squares`) scaffolded and ready for the next theorem pass

Longer-run goal:
- formalize as much of the book as is realistic, starting from probability / conditional expectation / projection foundations and moving outward toward asymptotics, least squares, testing, IV, GMM, time series, panel data, and beyond.

## Strategy

The intended workflow is:

1. extract and split the source PDF by chapter,
2. inventory theorem/lemma/corollary candidates,
3. identify the dependency graph,
4. formalize the lowest-level reusable results first,
5. commit frequently as each theorem cluster turns green.

In practice this means we will often restate Hansen’s results in more Lean-native language:
- sigma-algebras instead of only pointwise `E[Y | X = x]` notation,
- almost-everywhere equality where that is mathematically correct,
- projection and orthogonality statements in forms that line up with Mathlib.

## Repository structure

- `HansenEconometrics/` — Lean source files
- `notes/` — theorem inventories / progress notes
- `HansenEconometrics.lean` — root imports
- `lakefile.toml`, `lake-manifest.json`, `lean-toolchain` — Lean project config

## Chapter progress

Legend:
- `not started`

## Current Chapter 2 progress

Completed in `HansenEconometrics/Chapter2CondExp.lean`:
- simple law of iterated expectations
- tower property for nested sigma-algebras
- tower property in the `X₁, X₂` then `X₁` form
- conditioning / pull-out theorem
- CEF error has conditional mean zero
- CEF error has unconditional mean zero
- orthogonality of CEF error to measurable functions

Planned next within Chapter 2:
- variance decomposition / total variance
- conditional expectation as best predictor
- linear projection / best linear predictor
- later chapter 2 identification / existence statements where worthwhile

## Philosophy

The point is not to force Hansen’s prose into Lean line by line. The point is to build a usable formal skeleton of the mathematics behind the book.

That means:
- proving reusable infrastructure first,
- preferring mathematically canonical formulations,
- and being honest about what is already in Mathlib versus what we are adding on top.
